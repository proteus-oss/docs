## About

Proteus is named for a lost play in the Oresteia trilogy, featuring the tragedy of Cassandra. Only a two-line
fragment of the play remains. Proteus helps keep track of your cassandra ;) 

This website design was developed by the [ClojureWerkz Team](http://github.com/clojurewerkz)
and their [docslate](http://github.com/clojurewerkz/docslate) project.

The migration logic uses smartcat.io's
[cassandra-migration-java](https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-migration-tool-java) driver
to power migration logic.

Proteus is actively developed and used at [Ping Identity Corporation](https://www.pingidentity.com/).
